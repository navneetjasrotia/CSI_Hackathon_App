# CSI_Hackathon_App
This android app will allow any starter team to raise funds for their startups and also contact any mentor if they need any help regarding their startup.



The main problem of hackathon is that the Govt. haven't any proper database where they can store all the personal information of startups and provide funds to them and provide any mentor to them if necessary.



For this we have created an app where we have made a database from sqllite to store all th data of the startups and we have also provide some options where any person can raise funds for their startups and if they need any help they can contact any mentor from our app.
